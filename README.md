# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction
As a Data Scientist, this project focuses on predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)—a crucial metric for businesses aiming to understand customer profitability over time. By analyzing purchase behavior, 

transaction history, and customer interactions, we can estimate the long-term value of a customer and optimize marketing and retention strategies.

## Key Objectives:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather customer data, including transaction records, demographics, and engagement metrics, while handling missing values and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify key drivers influencing customer spending, retention, and churn.

Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features such as recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM), customer tenure, and engagement patterns.

Model Development: Implement and compare predictive models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), and Neural Networks.

Evaluation Metrics: Use RMSE, MAE, and R² Score to assess model accuracy and generalization.

Segmentation & Insights: Group customers into segments (e.g., high-value, at-risk, churn-prone) for targeted marketing strategies.

Deployment & Business Impact: Deploy the model to provide real-time CLV predictions, helping businesses optimize customer acquisition, retention, and personalized marketing campaigns.

By accurately predicting CLV, businesses can enhance customer relationships, improve profitability, and allocate resources efficiently for long-term growth.
